# odin-recipes

All boilerplates on website were written by hand.

Structure on every html file inside recipes dir is almost the same.

Things that are different on recipe files is ingredients sections: 
    Spinach artichoke file has unordered nested lists;
    Cocktail meatballs has just 1 unordered list;
    Brownies has another heading (Frosting) as sub-section.

I took the recipes and content from allrecipes.com.
