# odin-recipes

Website is made of a few recipes and index page with those recipes.

Structure of every recipe webpage is almost the same.

Things that are different on recipe webpages are ingredients sections:
Spinach artichoke webpage has unordered nested lists;
Cocktail meatballs has just 1 unordered list;
Brownies has another heading (Frosting) as sub-section.

I took the recipes and content from allrecipes.com.
