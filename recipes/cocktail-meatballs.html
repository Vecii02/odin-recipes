    <p class="about">
      These tasty cocktail meatballs will disappear quickly at your holiday
      party. My mom makes them every year for New Year's Eve, and so do I. These
      do very well in a slow cooker, as you can simmer them before serving and
      keep them hot for the duration of your party.
